AugmentImg ðŸ“š
=========

AugmentImg is an open-source, Python-based tool crafted to augment image datasets by applying a wide array of transformations. It aims to enrich machine learning datasets with varied data, enhancing model robustness without changing the original image sizes.

Features
--------

- **Intuitive Graphical Interface**: Leveraging PyQt5, AugmentImg offers a straightforward GUI, making it accessible for both technical and non-technical users.
- **Diverse Augmentation Suite**: Includes horizontal and vertical flips, color jittering, rotations, and more, ensuring a broad spectrum of image variations.
- **Preservation of Image Integrity**: Augments images without resizing, maintaining the original dimensions and quality of the data.
- **Support for Common Image Formats**: Compatible with popular formats like PNG, JPEG, TIFF, BMP, and GIF, catering to a wide range of use cases.

Installation
------------

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or newer installed. Follow these steps to set up AugmentImg:

1. Clone the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/zamalali/AugmentImg.git
   cd AugmentImg

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
-----

1. Launch AugmentImg:

.. code-block:: bash

   python main_ui.py

2. The GUI will prompt you to select an image folder. After selection, it displays the current image count.

3. Input the desired total number of images in the designated field.

4. Initiate the augmentation process by clicking on "Augment Images". Augmented images are saved in a subdirectory named `augmented` within the selected folder.

Supported Image Formats
-----------------------

AugmentImg works seamlessly with the following image extensions:

- .png
- .jpg, .jpeg
- .tiff
- .bmp

Customizing Augmentations
-------------------------

Adjust the `get_transform` function in `augment.py` to tailor the augmentation process to your specific needs, adding or removing transformations as required.
