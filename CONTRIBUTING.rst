=========================

First off, thank you for considering contributing to AugmentImg! It's people like you that make AugmentImg such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Quick Links
-----------

- `Project Issues <https://github.com/zamalali/AugmentImg/issues>`_
- `Pull Requests <https://github.com/zamalali/AugmentImg/pulls>`_

Getting Started
---------------

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We welcome contributions to all aspects of the project, including documentation, examples, tests, and code.

Contributing Code
-----------------

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

Reporting Bugs
--------------

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by `opening a new issue <https://github.com/zamalali/AugmentImg/issues/new>`_; it's that easy!

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

Feature Requests
----------------

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.
Augmentimg shall support pascal_voc format shortly. We are working on extending our package to all kinds of annotations including xml files.
